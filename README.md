## Hey 👋, I'm [Yujan Bajagain!](https://github.com/GamingClaus/)

Having just graduated high school, I'm passionate about solving problems and creating new things. That's why I'm starting to learn programming with Java through self-study. I'm excited to build my skills and connect with other developers!
